# 🔬 Scientific Evidence

Mission100 is designed based on the latest sports science research.

## 📚 Key Research Studies

### 🏆 Harvard Study (2019)
**40+ Push-ups → 96% Lower CVD Risk**

> Yang J, et al. (2019). Association Between Push-up Exercise Capacity and Future Cardiovascular Events Among Active Adult Men. *JAMA Network Open*, 2(2):e188341.

- 10-year follow-up, 1,104 male participants
- Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health
- DOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.8341

### 💪 Push-up Effectiveness (2017-2018)
**Bodyweight Push-ups = Bench Press**

> Kotarsky CJ, et al. (2018). Effect of Progressive Calisthenic Push-up Training on Muscle Strength and Thickness. *J Strength Cond Res*, 32(3):651-659.

> Kikuchi N, et al. (2017). Effect of Progressive Calisthenic Push-up Training. *J Exerc Sci Fit*, 15(1):37-42.

- Progressive repetition increase is effective
- Same effect as bench press for beginners

---

### 📅 Training Frequency (2016, 2019)
**2-3x Per Week + 48h Recovery**

> Schoenfeld BJ, et al. (2016). Effects of Resistance Training Frequency on Measures of Muscle Hypertrophy. *Sports Med*, 46(11):1689-1697.

> Schoenfeld BJ, et al. (2019). How many times per week should a muscle be trained? *J Sports Sci*, 37(11):1286-1295.

- 2x per week > 1x per week (hypertrophy)
- 48-hour recovery required
- Daily training is inefficient

---

### 🔥 HIIT + Resistance (2024) 🆕
**Combined > Solo Training**

> Wang Y, et al. (2024). Combined high-intensity interval and resistance training improves cardiorespiratory fitness. *Front Endocrinol*, 15:1450944.

- HIIT + resistance improves cardiorespiratory fitness more
- Improved strength + metabolic markers
- Scientific basis for push-ups + burpees

---

### ⏱️ Rest Intervals (2018)
**60-120 Seconds Optimal**

> Grgic J, et al. (2018). Effects of Rest Interval Duration in Resistance Training. *Sports Med*, 48(1):137-151.

- Hypertrophy goal: 60-90 seconds
- Beginners: 60-120 seconds
- Advanced: 120+ seconds

---

### 📈 Progressive Overload (2022)
**Repetition Increase = Load Increase**

> Plotkin D, et al. (2022). Progressive overload without progressing load? *PeerJ*, 10:e14142.

- Repetition progression is effective
- 6.7-12.9% muscle gain in 8 weeks
- Possible without external equipment
